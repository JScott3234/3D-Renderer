# 3D Renderer
A Basic Render Pipeline that uses the Barycentric Coordinates to Rasterize Triangles.

Credit to Rogach's 3D Rendering Tutorial for teaching me the basics of Calcualting Rotation and Rasterization/Shading: http://blog.rogach.org/2015/08/how-to-create-your-own-simple-3d-render.html

Future Plans: 
* Compartmentalize parts of the RenderTest.java file so that the JFrame and Render Processing parts are separate classes
* Make Rendering available for multiple objects, and have the camera focus on rotating the scene (maybe work on better camera turning)
